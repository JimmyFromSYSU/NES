INFO: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-165) writefirst - Synchronous clocking for BRAM (ppu_test/oam/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SDP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram) in SDP mode with Write First mode may have address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports. It is suggested to simulate the design to determine if any possible address collisions could exist in the design.  If so it is suggested to evaluate ways to eliminate the collisions or you may change the write mode to Read First which may reduce some performance and consume more power however will delay the writing thus resolving any potential collisions.  See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
